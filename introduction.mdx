## ‚õëÔ∏è Operational use cases

As we're thinking of this **Common Operating Terminal** as a one-stop shop for healthcare professionals to manage operations, we're looking at some key areas where we can assist these people to save time and improve their efficency by handing off more laborious tasks to an AI Copilot.

We're discovering use cases that can be addressed using AI Copilot in small to large operations setting in healthcare.

- **Processing insurance claims:** There are 50 forms in Hong Kong that take 20 mins / form to fill. Nurses manually go through patient data and fill these forms, which can be fully automated. This enables filling insurance claim forms in one-click.
- **Surfacing chronic patients and managing their follow up:** Often healthcare providers work in tandem with insurance backers, who want to keep patients healthy but have to run analysis on large records manually to assess which patients need follow up at what intervals.
- **Recording consultations and generating summaries:** Doctor consultations can last anywhere b/w 2 mins to 20+ minutes, where doctors have conversations with patients. These can be recorded, summarized, and professional summarizes can be shared with both patient and doctor.

- **Drug Search:** Doctors can seamlessly search for drugs with the COT. Not only does it provide information about the drug but it also integrates patient-specific information, analyzing the potential effects in relation to the patient‚Äôs current condition.
- **Analyzing patient condition:** The Clinical Operating Terminal allows doctors to analyze a patient‚Äôs current medical condition and compare it with the recommended drug or treatment plan. Given GPT-4‚Äôs 95% accuracy on United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), it can analyze fairly complex situations. By leveraging the such capabilities, the terminal can generate comprehensive answers and reports and provide insights based on medical examinations and data analysis.
- **Professionalizing Notes:** Notes can be uploaded in the form of pictures or typed directly into the terminal. Both raw and professionalized versions are saved for future reference, and advanced translation tools are available to ensure effective communication across different languages, enabling easy sharing with concerned individuals.
- **Patient Medical History Ingestion:** The terminal can ingest patient reports ahead of a scheduled appointment, providing doctors with a summarized overview of the patient‚Äôs medical history. It allows the doctor to quickly ask questions and draw connections, facilitating a more efficient consultation process. Doctor doesn‚Äôt have to spend time asking questions to the patient, which may lead to mis-understanding, time wasted.
- **Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) Search:** A groundbreaking function of the terminal is the ability to search CTM using natural language. Doctors can retrieve details about specific treatments, herbal remedies, and associated research. Additionally, with the assistance of General AI, doctors can investigate and gain deeper insights into the efficacy and applications of Chinese Traditional Medicine.
- **Doctor details and communication:** The terminal offers a comprehensive database of doctors‚Äô details, including their professional capabilities, schedules, and contact information. Doctors can access this information easily, enabling them to refer patients to specialists, communicate with colleagues, or seek consultations, all through a single interface.
- **Referrals:** Doctors can seamlessly generate referrals to other doctors or specialists for further evaluation or treatment. The Clinical Operating Terminal simplifies the referral process, making it more efficient and ensuring a smooth transition of patient care.
- **Multilingual:** To bridge communication gaps, the terminal supports multi-language user interfaces and translations. A question in any language is translated on the fly and responses are streamed back in the same language, allowing a global usability for doctors in Asian countries, where English is not first language.
