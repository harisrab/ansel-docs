This release is a major as it involves a number of improvements to the user experience when querying data sources using WhatsApp interface. It eliminates majority of errors, where LLM used to respond with no-information. Most queries to webpage data sources used to timeout, but now we've implemented a new backend design that allows for rapid and comprehensive response everytime a user asks a relevent question.

**Data Source Module:**

- Allows for adding and removing custom webpages that are automatically indexed in Vector database for LLM retrieval.
- Indicators for the status of indexing state of all webpages.
- Added support for connecting multiple modules for `Webpage Data Sources`.

**New Features and Bug Fixes:**

- Added OpenAI's GPT-4 Support.
- Responds to queries running longer than 30s.
- Cleaned up entire database for 3 major clinics in Hong Kong, significantly improving database operations using LLMs.
- Incorporated support to query Webpages and SQL databases simultaneously using a more complex question that requires a chain of thought and extraction of data from multiple sources.
- Eliminating majority user side errors when querying Doctor's Database through use of improved prompt engineering for dealing with `SQL Database Module`.
- Indicator on WhatsApp if the message takes longer than 15s to be delivered. (Better mechanism in-loop).
- Improved backend capacity for handling larger data sources (150 comprehensive records of doctors phone numbers, emails, bio, expertise, etc + multiple blocks of webpages).
- Save application with `CMD + S` on MacOS with live syncing.
