Hydra chat interface has been enhanced for an amazing user experience. We've incorportated changes so the interface remains responsive when retriving dense data sources. We've achieved this in three ways:

1. You know what tools the agent is using to synthesize your answer.
2. Streaming responses without occassional hickups in generation failing.
3. Source citations for data retrieved from Google, PubMed, OpenFDA, etc.

#### Medical Tools as Add-ons

For complex clinical questions, it's important that LLMs are grounded in truthful information with information from reputed medical sources.
To this end, we've added support for the following new tools:

1. OpenFDA Drug Search
2. PubMed Medical Literature
3. In-house database of doctors in Hong Kong

When citing from these sources, links are made available for you to visit and explore the topic more deeply.

#### Don't wait, see how your AI is thinking.

Immediately know what your AI is doing, how it's thinking, and synthesizing your answer. This gives you insight into the thought process. If you think AI is not accessing the right tools, just cancel generation, and guide it to use the appropriate tool and get the right answer.
