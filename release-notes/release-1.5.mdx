#### Native MacOS Application
The ability for the users to have a downloaded application and see all the latest updates on their laptop is very useful as they don't have to selectively open up a site. It's just navigating to another window that helps with UX.

#### Select language models
Switch between faster and slower models quickly without jumping into the design tool. This gives an out of the box experience.

#### Fictional EHR (Testing Purposes)

We've added the capability to view fictional patient records and search them, ask questions about them, using a chat terminal. This is not connected to a fully functional EHR, but we're planning to do that in future releases.
