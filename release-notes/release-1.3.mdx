#### 40% Increase in Response Speed

**Streaming:** This allows responses to be streamed as AI agents think and formulate an answer, we show it as its being generated. This drastically reduces latency, where response times become a lot faster.

**Improved short-term memory & data indexing strategy:** There were many operations being done the moment the user asks a question, but now there are optimizations in place to help improve response times by 13s.

#### Some Controls During Response Generation
We've implmented a few controls to start with to allow users to cancel generation and see the answers as they are being generated.
